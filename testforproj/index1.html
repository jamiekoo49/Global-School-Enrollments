    <h1> Global School Enrollment and Its Impacts</h1>
    <h2>Sahana Dhar, Madelyn Redick, Sophia Watanabe, Jamie Koo</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>Global school enrollment is a critical indicator of educational access and quality
        worldwide, impacting individual and societal development in numerous ways. This topic is
        important and interesting for several reasons. Firstly, higher enrollment rates are often associated
        with a more educated workforce, which can drive innovation, enhance productivity, and
        contribute to economic growth. Analyzing global school enrollment data can provide insights
        into future economic prospects for different countries and regions. Secondly, education is linked
        to a wide range of societal and health benefits, including mortality rates. Exploring the impacts
        of school enrollment can highlight the importance of education in achieving broader societal
        goals. Lastly, data on global school enrollment can inform policymakers, international
        organizations, and investors about areas where educational infrastructure and support are most
        needed. This can help direct resources more effectively, ensuring that investments in education
        yield the greatest societal and economic returns.</p>

    <p>Our dataset on global education is sourced from The World Bank, and specifically
        focuses on school enrollment. The dataset is a comprehensive collection of data that spans
        multiple countries and covers various years. With 43,629 rows and 67 columns of data, this
        dataset offers an in-depth look at educational indicators, including enrollment rates across
        different education levels (primary, secondary, and tertiary) and other relevant metrics such as
        progression to secondary education by gender. This dataset enables a wide range of analyses
        from trend analysis and comparative studies across regions or countries to evaluate the impact of
        educational policies. Furthermore, it allows for exploring the connection between education and
        factors like economic growth, health outcomes, and gender equality</p>

    <p>Does government spending have an impact on the progression from primary school to secondary?​
        Is there a pattern among a country's GDP, literacy rates, unemployment, and school enrollment levels?​
        Are there any correlations between youth death rates and the number of adolescents not enrolled in school</p>
