    <h1> Global School Enrollment and Its Impacts on Socioeconomic Factors</h1>
    <h2>Sahana Dhar, Madelyn Redick, Sophia Watanabe, Jamie Koo</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>Global school enrollment is a critical indicator of educational access and quality
        worldwide, impacting individual and societal development in numerous ways. Higher enrollment rates are often
        associated
        with a more educated workforce, which can drive innovation, enhance productivity, and
        contribute to economic growth. Additionally, analyzing global school enrollment data can provide insights
        into future economic prospects for different countries and regions. In another aspect, education is linked
        to a wide range of societal and health benefits, including mortality rates. Exploring the impacts
        of school enrollment can highlight the importance of education in achieving broader societal
        goals. Also, data on global school enrollment can inform policymakers, international
        organizations, and investors about areas where educational infrastructure and support are most
        needed. This can help direct resources more effectively, ensuring that investments in education
        yield the greatest societal and economic returns.</p>

    <p>Our dataset on global education is sourced from The World Bank, and specifically
        focuses on school enrollment. The dataset is a comprehensive collection of data that spans
        multiple countries and covers various years. With 43,629 rows and 67 columns of data, this
        dataset offers an in-depth look at educational indicators, including enrollment rates across
        different education levels (primary, secondary, and tertiary) and other relevant metrics such as
        progression to secondary education by gender. This dataset enables a wide range of analyses
        from trend analysis and comparative studies across regions or countries to evaluate the impact of
        educational policies. Furthermore, it allows for exploring the connection between education and
        socioeconomic factors like economic growth, health outcomes, and gender equality.</p>

            <p> Africa, Asia, and North America have similar ranges, but African and Asian countries tend to spend about
                2%-4% of their GDP on education while North American countries more frequently dedicate 3%-6%. Europe,
                Oceania, and South America also have similar ranges, with their countries each typically spending 4%-6%
                of their GDP on education funding. Analyzing government funding of education is important in
                understanding its effects on a society because it impacts the quality, duration, and accessibility of
                education systems. </p>

            <p>Lower secondary education is often considered the basic minimum for literacy and numeracy skills, which
                are essential for
                success in higher levels of education and in the workforce. Understanding the educational attainment at
                this level helps
                policymakers identify gaps and weaknesses in the education system, allowing them to allocate resources
                more effectively.
                From the line plot, it can be seen that there was a steady increase in attainment rates from 2004 -
                2010, perhaps indicating
                a global improvement in access to education and education systems. The attainment rate then fluctuates
                slightly between 14 to 18
                percent between 2011 - 2019. There is a significant and abrupt decline observed from 2020 - 2022 where
                the rate falls sharply
                to 2%. This abrupt decline in lower secondary educational attainment rate could possibly be attributed
                to the COVID-19
                pandemic where widespread school closures and the resultant economic strains placed on families led to
                disruptions in education.
                This suggests a need for robust contingency planning and the development of resilient educational
                systems that can withstand such crises.
                Additionally, targeted support for vulnerable populations, including economic relief for families and
                mental health services for
                students, becomes critical to mitigate the impacts of such shocks on educational outcomes.

            <p>The median lower secondary educational attainment rate and the interquartle range (blue box) for males
                appear to be slightly
                higher than for females (pink box), which suggests that on a global scale, males may have a slightly
                higher rate of lower
                secondary educational attainment rates than females. This difference in educational attainment rates
                between genders suggests
                that despite the advancees made, the persistence of even a slight gender gap signals that educatonal
                access and completion
                rates are stll influenced by underlying, often complex, and interrelated barriers. These can include
                soco-cultural norms that
                may prioritize male education, economic factos that might disproportionally impat females, or ecen
                systemic policy
                oversights that fail to address the specific needs of one gender. Moreover, both male and female
                distributions have a wide range,
                which suggests that there is considerable variability in the attainment rates within each gender group.
                This may be caused by
                factors such as geographic disparities, which may reflect the uneven distriibuton of educational
                resources, quality of schooling,
                or regional economic stability.

            <p> This interactive scatterplot has primary school enrollment levels on the x axis and a
                dynamic y axis with options to plot unemployment rates, literacy rates,
                progression to secondary school, and more. It features an interactive legend that
                shows only data from a selected continent. Hovering over a specific data point
                shows the name of the country and the year in which the data was collected.
                This plot is extremely helpful in understanding the dataset as a whole, since it
                allows us to compare how global enrollment rates impacts other variables of interest.
                For example, when ‘Progression to secondary school (%)’ is selected as the y axis variable,
                there is a dense cluster of regions with high primary school enrollment rates and high levels
                of progression from primary school to secondary school, while other portions of the data are
                more widespread. This indicates that there is a strong correlation between the two variables,
                that there is some type of relationship between them. However, the presence of outliers and
                variations across regions suggests that there are factors other than primary school enrollment
                involved in progression rates. </p>

        <p> Data on compulsory education duration becomes available starting from 1995, with North Korea being the sole
            country with
            available data for that year, mandating 11 years of compulsory education. By 1998, data becomes available
            for many countries.
            The maximum compulsory education duration observed across countries in any given year is 17 years (Venezuela
            in 2021), while the
            minimum is 5 years for several nations. Overall, while many countries were steadfast in the number of
            compulsory years, others
            increased the number of years of compulsory education. The best example of this is South America. Many
            countries in this region
            have increased the number of years over time from below 10 to over 10 over the course of two decades. In
            2022
            (the most recent year with available data), it's evident that South America overall has the highest number
            of compulsory years of education.
            This contrasts with Africa, which varies more by country, but generally requires fewer years of compulsory
            education on average.
            Other regions, such as North America, tend to be more inconsistent.

            It's important to remember that the years of compulsory education are not equivalent to actual school
            enrollment, nor do they equate
            to educational quality. Rather, this map seeks to provide a baseline understanding of the amount of
            education mandated by governments
            worldwide and to what degree this varies from country to country.

    <h3>Analysis and Conclusion</h3>

    <p>The analysis of global school enrollment data offers insights into the state of education worldwide and its
        multifaceted impacts on societal development. By examining various aspects such as government spending on
        education, attainment rates at the lower secondary level, gender differences, and compulsory education
        durations, we gain a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities within the global education
        landscape. Government expenditure on education emerges as a critical factor influencing the quality,
        accessibility, and duration of educational systems. Disparities in spending patterns across continents emphasize
        the importance of allocating resources effectively to ensure equitable access to education. Regions with higher
        spending percentages of GDP on education, such as Europe and Oceania, exhibit more consistent educational
        outcomes compared to regions with lower spending percentages, such as Africa and Asia. This highlights the need
        for targeted interventions to bolster educational infrastructure and support in regions with limited resources.
        The analysis of attainment rates at the lower secondary level unveils a concerning trend marked by a sharp
        decline in rates following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This decline demonstrates the vulnerability of
        education systems to external shocks and emphasizes the importance of building resilient educational frameworks
        capable of withstanding crises. Furthermore, the observed gender differentials in educational attainment rates
        highlight persistent challenges in achieving gender parity in education. The examination of compulsory education
        durations across countries reveals varying mandates, with some nations steadily increasing the number of years
        over time. While South America emerges as a region with the highest compulsory education durations, Africa
        exhibits greater variability, reflecting diverse policy approaches across nations. However, it's crucial to
        recognize that compulsory education durations do not necessarily equate to actual school enrollment or
        educational quality. Nonetheless, they provide valuable insights into government priorities and commitments to
        education.
    </p>
    <p>The analysis of global school enrollment data shows the interactions between education, socio-economic factors,
        and policy interventions. Higher enrollment rates not only contribute to economic growth but also foster
        societal development. However, challenges such as disparities in government spending, gender differences, and
        the impact of external shocks underscore the imperative for targeted interventions and resilient educational
        systems.</p>
