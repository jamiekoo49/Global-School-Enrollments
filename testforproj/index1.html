    <h1> Global School Enrollment and Its Impacts on Socioeconomic Factors</h1>
    <h2>Sahana Dhar, Madelyn Redick, Sophia Watanabe, Jamie Koo</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>Global school enrollment is a critical indicator of educational access and quality
        worldwide, impacting individual and societal development in numerous ways. Higher enrollment rates are often
        associated
        with a more educated workforce, which can drive innovation, enhance productivity, and
        contribute to economic growth. Additionally, analyzing global school enrollment data can provide insights
        into future economic prospects for different countries and regions. In another aspect, education is linked
        to a wide range of societal and health benefits, including mortality rates. Exploring the impacts
        of school enrollment can highlight the importance of education in achieving broader societal
        goals. Also, data on global school enrollment can inform policymakers, international
        organizations, and investors about areas where educational infrastructure and support are most
        needed. This can help direct resources more effectively, ensuring that investments in education
        yield the greatest societal and economic returns.</p>

    <p>Our dataset on global education is sourced from The World Bank, and specifically
        focuses on school enrollment. The dataset is a comprehensive collection of data that spans
        multiple countries and covers various years. With 43,629 rows and 67 columns of data, this
        dataset offers an in-depth look at educational indicators, including enrollment rates across
        different education levels (primary, secondary, and tertiary) and other relevant metrics such as
        progression to secondary education by gender. This dataset enables a wide range of analyses
        from trend analysis and comparative studies across regions or countries to evaluate the impact of
        educational policies. Furthermore, it allows for exploring the connection between education and
        socioeconomic factors like economic growth, health outcomes, and gender equality.</p>

            <p> Africa, Asia, and North America have similar ranges, but African and Asian countries tend to spend about
                2%-4% of their GDP on education while North American countries more frequently dedicate 3%-6%. Europe,
                Oceania, and South America also have similar ranges, with their countries each typically spending 4%-6%
                of their GDP on education funding. Analyzing government funding of education is important in
                understanding its effects on a society because it impacts the quality, duration, and accessibility of
                education systems. </p>

            <p> This interactive scatterplot has primary school enrollment levels on the x axis and a
                dynamic y axis with options to plot unemployment rates, literacy rates,
                progression to secondary school, and more. It features an interactive legend that
                shows only data from a selected continent. Hovering over a specific data point
                shows the name of the country and the year in which the data was collected.
                This plot is extremely helpful in understanding the dataset as a whole, since it
                allows us to compare how global enrollment rates impacts other variables of interest.
                For example, when ‘Progression to secondary school (%)’ is selected as the y axis variable,
                there is a dense cluster of regions with high primary school enrollment rates and high levels
                of progression from primary school to secondary school, while other portions of the data are
                more widespread. This indicates that there is a strong correlation between the two variables,
                that there is some type of relationship between them. However, the presence of outliers and
                variations across regions suggests that there are factors other than primary school enrollment
                involved in progression rates. </p>

        <p>     Data on compulsory education duration becomes available starting from 1995, with North Korea being the sole country with 
            available data for that year, mandating 11 years of compulsory education. By 1998, data becomes available for many countries. 
            The maximum compulsory education duration observed across countries in any given year is 17 years (Venezuela in 2021), while the 
            minimum is 5 years for several nations. Overall, while many countries were steadfast in the number of compulsory years, others 
            increased the number of years of compulsory education. The best example of this is South America. Many countries in this region 
            have increased the number of years over time from below 10 to over 10 over the course of two decades. In 2022 
            (the most recent year with available data), it's evident that South America overall has the highest number of compulsory years of education. 
            This contrasts with Africa, which varies more by country, but generally requires fewer years of compulsory education on average. 
            Other regions, such as North America, tend to be more inconsistent.

            It's important to remember that the years of compulsory education are not equivalent to actual school enrollment, nor do they equate 
            to educational quality. Rather, this map seeks to provide a baseline understanding of the amount of education mandated by governments 
            worldwide and to what degree this varies from country to country.
